                      <p>When we first started we thought of Kiwi. She was our first character since we didn't know exactly who to give as her friend. We needed someone who would be able to ignore/urge her embaressing habbits as well as someone to keep her in check. Someone to hype her up and keep her going so she wouldn't just stop and give up. When we were thinking about how we wanted her to look we both agreed that we wanted her to look like a kiwi fruit(ü•ù), that's why her hair were Green and her eyes were brown.</p>

                  <p>Kiwi is a now 19 year old girl going through College and is going through for a coding major for no major reason but she just thought it would be cool to have. Before she met and fixed Proxy she was a loner that only had a 4 part routine, that would go on day by day. She would slowly more by more come out of her shell and experience more than what's inside her home. There is something about her that we have planned but it'd be nicer not to tell you and keep it a surprise.</p>

            <h2>Kiwi's Traits</h2>
            <p>These are the traits we came up for Kiwi.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>She has Orange cat energy (She's super energetic)</li>
                <li>Loud</li>
                <li>She has random bursts of energy, even when she's in tense situations</li>
                <li>She can be careless sometimes. She likes to wonder away from the group and attack animals in game.</li>
                <li>She's very classic which means she loves dressing in plain colors as well as listen to Piano and violin.</li>
                <li>When it comes to Rescuing or taking action, Kiwi can be pretty inpulsive. She doesn't think twice, which can be a good and bad trait for her.</li>
                <li>When the air is tense and Kiwi finds herself in a, tough prediciment, she start doing stupid things like making random noises or animal noises to calm her nerves or make her forget the horrors of the situation.</li>
                <li>She can also be a bit dramatic at times, rather it being they're being chased or a situation is making her rather irritated or bored.</li>
                <li>When it comes to arguments or anything that involves conflict she's very emotional, it's not something she enjoys but her emotions are just stronger than her will to hold it back.</li>
                <li>Same thing with situations where it can be killer, Kiwi is easily frightened. The smallest noise, snap or even creak would make her scream or flinch. The slightest movement would terrify her also if she's alone in a quiet room/area.</li>
            </ul>
