                <p>When Proxy came into play, we wanted someone to match his energy. Eventhough he isn't really the energetic type we thought it would be nice to give him someone the complete oppisite. We wanted him to be the friend that would ignore and urge someone to continue their playful habits, and also keep them in check. We wanted him to be somene to hype up his friend and keep them going so that no one would be stuck or stop at a crossroad. When we were thinking about how we wanted him to look like we came to an agreement to make him look like a slight sorcerer, which is why his right hand is surrounded with particals and his left hand is holding a spell book. </p>

                    <p>Proxy is an AI, programmed to look like an 19 year old boy. He lives inside Kiwis computer when they aren't doing adventures. He has alot of faint memories as well as some locked ones. Eventhough he sounds like he's very limited, he is still very useful and quick. Now that he is friends with Kiwi, it like his days are quicker and more stressful since he's the one to keep her in check so she wouldn't go off k*lling herself.</p>

            <h2>Proxy's Traits</h2>
            <p>These are the traits we came up for Proxy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>He has major Black cat energy(Very calm, laid back)</li>
                <li>When he thinks something seems obvious and someone reads it out loud, he can't help but have a sarcastic tone to his voice</li>
                <li>He also has his times when he can be a burst of energy and Kiwi has to take responsiblilty in keeping him in check so he doesn't go hurting people.</li>
                <li>He does have intrusive thoughts that he is very inpulsive on. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they are bad. it's kinda like a wheel in his head.</li>
                <li>When the air is tense and Proxy finds them in a tough prediciment, he would start doing stupid things like making random noises or animal noises to make himself and kiwi laugh and forget the horrors of the situation.</li>
                <li>He does have small voice crack, they couldn't figure out if it was a code error or the voice box error.</li>
                <li>Since he's so chill and has a 'don't care' attitude, he will have moments when he can be sentimental, but that's only when it's needed or he feels like it.</li>
