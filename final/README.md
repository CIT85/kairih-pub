# Double Trouble
## Why I chose this topic.

I chose this topic since it's a small mini-project that myself and my friend are planning to create into a mini-series. I have been very interested into this project since it is about something i am very proud and think strongly of as well as work hard on. The prompt we went with was that our two main characters, Kiwi and Proxy, are friends that are able to travel around the game universe (Minecraft, Roblox, Apex, Overwatch, etc.) and experience the game universe, as well as try to escape it together as a team or separately. Once they are done and return home, Kiwi will log everything into her journal. While going through these universes, they slowly find out more and more about each other and who they really are.


The topics I will be covering would be who the two characters are "Kiwi and proxy" on seperate plots, what their story is and how they began, as well as what type of conflict they would go through during their adventures or just themselves.
